[Inhaling and exhaling deeply]
[Male] OK... Here we go. Focus.
Speed. I am speed.
[Cars whizzing past]
One winner, 42 losers.
I eat losers for breakfast.
[Car accelerating]
Breakfast.
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.
[Cars whizzing]
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.
I am lightning!
[Pounding on door]
[Male] Hey, Lightning! You ready?
